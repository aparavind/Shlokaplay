This app actually helps in recitation of shlokas or for that matter any other text that requires recitation.

the basic methodology is as follows.

the know-er creates a folder which contains a json file , the set of mp3 files and its equivalent html files. the json file is of the following format 
{
	"Files": [
		{
			"mp3": "dhruva_001.mp3",
			"html": "001_dhruva.html"
		},
		{
			"mp3": "dhruva_002.mp3",
			"html": "002_dhruva.html"
		},
		{
			"mp3": "dhruva_003.mp3",
			"html": "003_dhruva.html"
		},
		{
		{
			"mp3": "dhruva_022.mp3",
			"html": "022_dhruva.html"
		},
		{
			"mp3": "dhruva_023.mp3",
			"html": "023_dhruva.html"
		}
	]
}

when loaded into the app. the app displays one html and simultaneously starts reciting the corresponding shloka.

we can loop the shloka , replay the shloka go to the next shloka etc all can be done
